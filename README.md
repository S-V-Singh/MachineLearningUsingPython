Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.<br>
__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

### HealthCare Provider Fraud Detection
| [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S-V-Singh/MachineLearningUsingPython/main/HealthCare/Images/Fraud_Detection.jpeg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S-V-Singh/MachineLearningUsingPython/main/HealthCare/Images/Fraud_Detection.jpeg)|<br>
Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.

Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.

Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:

a) Billing for services that were not provided.

b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.

c) Misrepresenting the service provided.

d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.

e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered. <br>
